# Layers Extraction from Draft Land Use Plan for Delhi 2041
Delhi Development Authority recently released draft land use plan 2041 for Delhi and called for public comments. This repo has some of the geospatial layers that I was able to extract from the PDF map of the [draft plan](http://119.226.139.196/tendernotices_docs/aug2020/Draft%20Land%20Use%20Plan_public%20notice09062021.pdf).
